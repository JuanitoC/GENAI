    "## Creating a CrewAI-compatible wrapper around LG tools\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### Purpose of this file\n",
    "\n",
    "This file defines a **CrewAI-compatible wrapper** around LangChain’s `GmailGetThread` tool. Without this wrapper, CrewAI throws a validation error because it expects tools to implement a specific interface (`BaseTool` or a callable with a `name`, `description`, and `func`).\n",

    "\n",

    "from crewai_tools import BaseTool\n",

    "**Why this line matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BaseTool` is CrewAI's expected base class for custom tools.\n",
    "* Tools **must inherit from `BaseTool`** and implement the `_run()` method for CrewAI to recognize them as valid.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### Defining the Tool Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class GmailThreadTool(BaseTool):\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This defines a **custom tool class** that inherits from `BaseTool`, satisfying CrewAI's expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    name: str = \"get_gmail_thread\"\n",
    "````\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    description: str = \"Retrieves the full Gmail thread by thread ID.\"\n",

    "#### Core Method\n",

    "    def _run(self, thread_id: str) -> str:\n",
    "        print(f\"[DEBUG] get_gmail_thread received thread_id: {thread_id}\")\n",
    "        return GmailGetThread().run(thread_id)\n",

    "✅ **This is the most important part.** CrewAI uses the `_run()` method under the hood to execute the tool.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",

    "* 🛑 In your original setup, you passed `GmailGetThread()` directly into the agent’s `tools` list — but that object is **not CrewAI-compliant**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**We used `GmailGetThread().run(thread_id)` inside `_run()`**:\n",
    "* ✅ This lets us reuse existing LangChain logic to fetch email threads without rewriting Gmail integration ourselves.\n",
