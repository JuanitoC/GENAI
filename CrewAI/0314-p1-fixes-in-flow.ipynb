    "## BEFORE vs AFTER: Line-by-Line Comparison & Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a **line-by-line breakdown** of the changes made to the `main.py` (CrewAI Flow file), explaining **what was changed, line-by-line, and why** each change was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### File Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This script defines the CrewAI flow for an **automated email responder**, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checking for unread Gmail messages\n",
    "* Passing them to a crew of agents\n",
    "* Handling output\n",
    "* Running on a timed loop\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import json\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "* `os`: Needed to create the `output/` directory if it doesn‚Äôt exist.\n",
    "* `json`: Used to serialize email data (`emails_json`) for structured agent input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### Function: `fetch_new_emails`\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"üîÑ Checking for new emails...\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "return self.state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Added logging of how many emails were found (helps understand batch size).\n",
    "* `return self.state` is **essential in CrewAI flows** ‚Äî it ensures the updated state is stored between steps. Missing this caused silent bugs.\n",

    "## Let's explain this with more detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing `@start`/`@listen` with a custom `run_once()` method is a **practical and clean solution** *when you're managing a custom loop manually*, **but only if you're not using CrewAI's built-in flow execution system** like `flow.kickoff()` or `flow.plot()` to orchestrate steps automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What `@start` and `@listen` Are For:\n",
    "\n",
    "* These decorators define **flow graphs** declaratively for CrewAI.\n",
    "* `@start` marks an entry point.\n",
    "* `@listen(func)` wires a task to run **after** the decorated one completes.\n",
    "* When you call `.kickoff()`, CrewAI runs the full pipeline **once** based on that flow graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Doesn‚Äôt Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original script used `@start` and `@listen`, then called `flow.kickoff()` ‚Äî which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Runs the flow once**\n",
    "* Then returns (hence why your terminal shows it's done)\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI **does not manage repetition** or long-running polling ‚Äî that's up to **you** to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why `run_once()` is a Good Idea Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're building a **long-running, looping** system (like a background email watcher), so:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **don‚Äôt want to re-initialize** the flow graph each time.\n",
    "* You need to **retain state** across runs (e.g., `checked_emails_ids`).\n",
    "* You need precise control over **when to run**, **when to pause**, and **how to handle failures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By collapsing the flow into a single `run_once()` method and calling it in a loop, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gain full control** over polling intervals and logic.\n",
    "* Keep things **simple and testable**.\n",
    "* Still fully use CrewAI (via `EmailFilterCrew().crew().kickoff(...)`) for agent task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendation for Production:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to retain the **graph-structured benefits** of `@start`/`@listen`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consider using `flow.kickoff()` **inside** the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = EmailAutoResponderFlow()\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    flow.kickoff()  # executes start ‚Üí listen chain\n",
    "    print(\"Sleeping...\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(180)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this **rebuilds flow state each time**, which may be inefficient or error-prone for stateful flows like yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Replacing `@start`/`@listen` with `run_once()` is **appropriate and better** in a polling-based automation scenario like yours, especially for production-like robustness and repeatability."
