    "#### Big Picture  \n",
    "This code builds a system (called a *flow*) that helps create a full, detailed **guide** on any topic. It gets the topic from the user, plans the guide structure with AI, writes the content for each section using a team of AI workers (*ContentCrew*), and saves everything nicely into files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step in plain English\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up the data formats**:  \n",
    "   - We define two data models (`Section` and `GuideOutline`) using **Pydantic**.  \n",
    "     Think of these like blueprints telling the system *\"this is what a guide or a section should look like.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a memory (state) class**:  \n",
    "   - We create a `GuideCreatorState` that holds the *topic*, *audience level*, *the guide outline*, and *the actual written sections*.  \n",
    "     This way, information can be passed between steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define the Flow**:  \n",
    "   A *Flow* is like a recipe, with different steps that happen in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 1** (`@start` decorator):  \n",
    "     - **Ask the user** what guide they want to create and who the guide is for (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Step 2** (`@listen(get_user_input)` decorator):  \n",
    "     - **Use an AI (LLM)** to create a guide outline automatically based on the user's input.\n",
    "     - The AI answers with a **structured JSON** that fits our `GuideOutline` model.\n",
    "     - This outline is **saved into a file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 3** (`@listen(create_guide_outline)` decorator):  \n",
    "     - For **each section** of the outline:\n",
    "       - Use a **content creation AI crew** (ContentCrew) to write the section.\n",
    "       - Keep track of the content as it's being written.\n",
    "     - After all sections are written, **assemble everything** (title, intro, sections, conclusion) into a final complete guide file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extra utilities**:  \n",
    "   - `kickoff()` starts the flow when you run the file.\n",
    "   - `plot()` can generate a visual map (diagram) of how the flow is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Ideas\n",
    "- **Flows** organize different actions in a smart, connected way.\n",
    "- **@start** defines the first step; **@listen** hooks up the next steps automatically when the previous one finishes.\n",
    "- **State** keeps the memory of what's going on across steps.\n",
    "- **Direct LLM calls** are used for creative tasks (like outlining).\n",
    "- **Crews** (small AI teams) are used for heavier tasks (like writing full sections)."
