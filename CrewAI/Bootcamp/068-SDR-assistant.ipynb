    "# Project: SDR Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name of the project folder:** sdr_assistant_flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a hands-on example of how to build an **AI-powered Sales Development Representative (SDR) Assistant** using **CrewAI**. It’s designed to demonstrate how multiple autonomous agents can work together as a coordinated \"crew\" to analyze leads and draft cold outreach emails—just like a real SDR team would do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Project Does\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the flow, the SDR Assistant will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accept a new lead record** (name, job title, company, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Analyze the lead's personal profile and business context** to determine how relevant and ready they are for outreach.\n",
    "3. **Score the lead** and generate insight about their alignment with the company's offerings.\n",
    "4. **Draft a personalized cold email**, and optimize it with strong CTAs to maximize engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this happens automatically through a series of well-orchestrated AI agents!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CrewAI Features in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates key CrewAI capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                     | How It’s Used                                                                           |\n",
    "| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Crew Structure**          | Two crews: one for lead analysis, one for email writing.                                |\n",
    "| **Multiple Agents**         | Each agent specializes in a task (e.g., analyzing role, writing copy, optimizing CTAs). |\n",
    "| **Sequential Process Flow** | Tasks are executed step-by-step: analyze → score → email → optimize.                    |\n",
    "| **Pydantic Integration**    | Uses Pydantic models to pass and validate structured data between tasks.                |\n",
    "| **Task Context Sharing**    | Email writers use insights from the lead analysis crew to craft personalized content.   |\n",
    "| **Tool Integration**        | Agents can use tools like web scraping or search (via CrewAI tool support).             |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Is a Great Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project gives you practical exposure to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designing real-world multi-agent workflows\n",
    "* Organizing tasks and agents with `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`\n",
    "* Using structured data (`lead_types.py`) across agent interactions\n",
    "* Building flows that mimic real business processes (like sales prospecting)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try Extending It!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand how it works, here are ideas for extending the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add more nuanced lead qualification criteria\n",
    "* Introduce a third crew for **follow-up sequencing**\n",
    "* Connect it to a real CRM or email API"

    "\n",
    "#### 1. `profile_insights_agent`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role**: Lead Profile Analyst\n",
    "* **Goal**: Extract key **personal and professional information** from the lead (e.g. name, job title, background).\n",
    "* **Backstory**: This agent acts like a detail-oriented researcher—someone who combs through a LinkedIn profile or resume to spot relevant insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it matters*: A well-crafted cold email starts with understanding who the person is. This agent ensures outreach is personalized and not generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `business_context_agent`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role**: Company Context Researcher\n",
    "* **Goal**: Gather **company-level insights** like industry, size, goals, or recent developments.\n",
    "* **Backstory**: Think of this agent like a market analyst. It researches what the company is up to, what challenges they may face, and how they might benefit from the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it matters*: Knowing the company’s situation helps tailor the pitch — e.g., “We saw you're expanding your AI team, and we think we can help.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `engagement_readiness_agent`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role**: Outreach Readiness Evaluator\n",
    "* **Goal**: Evaluate **how likely and timely** it is to reach out to this lead. Scores their \"readiness\" for contact.\n",
    "* **Backstory**: This is the strategist of the crew. It reads signals (like job role, market activity, alignment with the ICP) and decides if it’s the right time to start a conversation—and what the angle should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it matters*: This agent helps prioritize high-potential leads and suggests a tailored message angle to increase engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Agent Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents share two settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `verbose: true` → Makes them log more info to help you understand what they’re doing (great for debugging).\n",
    "* `allow_delegation: false` → They **don’t pass tasks** to other agents. Each one stays focused on their own job.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "In CrewAI, agents aren’t just code—they’re **personas** with roles and responsibilities. This file shows how you can design a team of specialists that work together, just like in a real sales team:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One understands the person (profile),\n",
    "* One understands the business (context),\n",
    "* One decides how and when to engage (readiness)."

    "* **Who handles it**: `profile_insights_agent`\n",
    "* **Details it looks for**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Name, job title, background\n",
    "  * Company size, industry, revenue\n",
    "  * Role relevance (how much buying power this person likely has)\n",

    "* **Why it matters**: This profile sets the foundation for a personalized and strategic cold email.\n",
    "\n",
    "*SDR Value*: It's like researching a lead on LinkedIn and Crunchbase before writing your first email.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `assess_engagement_fit`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it does**: It evaluates **how good a fit** this lead and company are for your offering, and how **ready** they might be for outreach.\n",
    "* **Who handles it**: `business_context_agent`\n",
    "* **What it looks for**:\n",
    "\n",

    "  * Alignment with AI Accelera's services\n",
    "  * Timing — does this feel like a good time to reach out?\n",
    "* **Scoring**: It gives a **readiness score from 0 to 10** and adds comments that could be used as **email talking points**.\n",

    "2. `assess_engagement_fit_task`: Judges strategic alignment and timing\n",
    "3. `generate_lead_readiness_score_task`: Combines everything into a final score\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task context**:\n",
    "The final task (`generate_lead_readiness_score_task`) receives the **output of the two earlier tasks** via the `context` argument. This lets it make decisions based on already-completed work.\n",

    "output_pydantic=LeadReadinessResult\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells CrewAI what **data structure** the task should return. In this case, it outputs:\n",

    "#### Final Takeaways for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "* `crew.py` is the **brain** of your CrewAI unit—it defines how your agents work together.\n",
    "* Each agent and task is configured separately (via YAML), promoting modularity and reusability.\n",
    "* Context passing between tasks and structured output with Pydantic are **powerful design patterns**.\n",
    "* Tool usage (like web search and scraping) adds real-world research capabilities."

    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Defining the Flow State\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SDRFlowState(BaseModel):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This class defines the **data the flow will track** from start to finish:\n",
    "\n",

    "* `analyzed_leads`: Structured analysis results returned by the first crew\n",
    "* `emails`: Final cold emails drafted by the second crew\n",
    "\n",

    "def load_leads(self):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* First step in the flow (triggered automatically)\n",
    "* Loads one or more leads manually (in a real app, this could be from a CRM or form)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Tip**: You can change this to load dynamic leads later from an API or DB.\n",

    "#### `analyze_leads`\n",

    "```python\n",
    "@listen(load_leads)\n",
    "def analyze_leads(self):\n",
    "```\n",

    "* Listens to the `load_leads` step\n",
    "* For each lead, it runs the **AnalyzeCustomerProfileCrew**\n",
    "* The result is a structured object: `LeadReadinessResult`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Tip**: This is where raw lead data becomes structured insights, using multiple agents behind the scenes.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "@listen(analyze_leads)\n",
    "def write_emails(self):\n",
    "```\n",

    "* Input: lead's personal info, company info, and engagement readiness\n",
    "* Output: a personalized cold email (as a string)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Tip**: This is how you reuse structured data from one crew to drive another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `simulate_send`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@listen(write_emails)\n",
    "def simulate_send(self):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "* In a real project, this could be replaced with logic to send via SMTP or an API\n",
