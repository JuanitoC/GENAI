    "- **Where it comes from**:  \n",
    "  `self.agents_config` is a dictionary that holds settings for all agents.  \n",
    "  You pick the **'researcher'** config from that dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `# type: ignore[index]`\n",
    "- **Meaning**:  \n",
    "  A note to **the Python type checker** (like `mypy`) to **ignore** any type errors about indexing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Why it's needed**:  \n",
    "  Sometimes static type checkers get confused about dynamic dictionaries like `agents_config`, so this avoids unnecessary warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It does **NOT** affect the running code.** It's only for tools like `mypy` or editors (e.g., VSCode).\n",

    "  Turn on **detailed logging** when the agent runs.\n",

    "- **Result**:  \n",

    "  The agent would run silently unless an error happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `tools=[SerperDevTool()]`\n",
    "- **Meaning**:  \n",
    "  Give the agent **external tools** it can use during its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In this case**:  \n",
    "  `SerperDevTool` is a tool that allows the agent to **search the web** — like using a mini-Google inside the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why important?**  \n",
    "  Without tools, an agent is \"blind\" to the outside world.  \n",
    "  Tools expand the agent's capabilities beyond just reasoning.\n",
