    "## Introduction: What is `agents.yaml`?\n",
    "\n",
    "This YAML file defines the **CrewAI agents**—their roles, goals, backstories, and behavior settings. Each agent has a clearly defined job in the pipeline, contributing to an efficient, automated email workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through each agent one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "## `email_filter_agent`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Role**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "role: >\n",
    "  Email Filtering Assistant\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This agent acts as a **first-level triage bot** for incoming emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "goal: >\n",
    "  Review incoming emails and categorize them into relevant groups such as urgent, informational, spam, and actionable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The agent's goal is **classification**, which helps downstream agents handle emails more efficiently.\n",
    "* Categories like **urgent**, **informational**, **spam**, and **actionable** are practical and commonly used in productivity workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Backstory**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "backstory: >\n",
    "  You are a smart assistant trained in email management. Your specialty is analyzing the content and context of emails to classify them effectively, enabling downstream agents to work efficiently.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The backstory provides the LLM with motivation and context.\n",
    "* It encourages thoughtful classification by reminding the agent it’s **part of a larger system** (i.e., teamwork).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **System Message**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "system_message: >\n",
    "  Always preserve the original `threadId` and `id` fields. Never invent values.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This instruction enforces **data integrity**.\n",
    "* Prevents the LLM from “hallucinating” or altering key metadata that is used to track and respond to emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **LLM Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "llm: openai/gpt-4o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses GPT-4o, which balances quality and speed well for content understanding and tagging tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "## `email_action_agent`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Role**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "role: >\n",
    "  Email Action Identifier\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This agent identifies **what needs to be done** based on the filtered email categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "goal: >\n",
    "  Analyze filtered emails and identify those that require a response, follow-up, or any other action.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goes beyond just labeling — it determines **whether action is needed**, and possibly what kind of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Backstory**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "backstory: >\n",
    "  You are a productivity-oriented email operations specialist. Your job is to read through filtered messages and determine which ones need further attention or action, minimizing overlooked responsibilities.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Emphasizes reliability and action-orientation.\n",
    "* Helps the model focus on **task relevance** over mere content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **LLM Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "llm: openai/gpt-4o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also uses GPT-4o to handle slightly more complex logical decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "## `email_response_writer`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Role**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "role: >\n",
    "  Email Drafting Assistant\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This agent **writes** email replies when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "goal: >\n",
    "  Draft clear, professional, and context-aware responses to emails that require a reply.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focuses on tone, clarity, and relevance in email composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Backstory**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "backstory: >\n",
    "  You are a skilled communication assistant with a strong grasp of tone, etiquette, and context. You specialize in drafting polished email responses based on previous email threads and relevant online information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adds a human-like personality and professionalism to the agent.\n",
    "* Enables the LLM to consider **thread context**, which is essential for coherent replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **LLM Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "llm: openai/gpt-4o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* GPT-4o is particularly effective at maintaining **tone and context**, making it ideal for email drafting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent handles a specific task (filtering, action identification, drafting).\n",
    "2. **Pipeline Thinking**: Output from one agent feeds into the next — a classic assembly line approach.\n",
    "3. **Prompt Design**: The `role`, `goal`, and `backstory` work together to guide the LLM’s behavior without micromanaging.\n",
    "4. **System Constraints**: Use of `system_message` ensures critical metadata is preserved.\n",
    "5. **Modular Configuration**: Easy to extend or swap agents if business logic changes."
