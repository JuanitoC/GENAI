    "#### The YAML configuration (the crew.py we find in the typical crewAI template)\n",
    "* @CrewBase, @agent, @task, @crew, and other optional decorators (@before_kickoff, @after_kickoff) help in organizing the crew’s structure and automatically collecting agents and tasks without manually listing them.\n",
    "    * @CrewBase: Marks the class as a crew base class.\n",
    "    * @agent: Denotes a method that returns an Agent object.\n",
    "    * @task: Denotes a method that returns a Task object.\n",

    "#### But... is the crew.py a YAML configuration, or just a Python file?\n",
    "The `crew.py` code **does use a YAML configuration** —although the actual YAML content isn't shown in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can tell:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These lines indicate that the code expects to load agent and task configurations from YAML files:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml' \n",
    "  tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Agent` and `Task` objects are being instantiated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  config=self.agents_config['agent_one']  # type: ignore[index]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  which implies that `self.agents_config` is expected to be a dictionary-like object (parsed from YAML) containing entries like `agent_one` and `agent_two`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The code in `crew.py` is designed to use **external YAML files** (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) to define agent and task configurations. These files must exist in the `config/` directory and contain appropriately structured YAML entries."
