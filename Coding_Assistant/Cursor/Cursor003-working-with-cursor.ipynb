    "    *  Tell what you want to change using natural language.\n",
    "* **Option #3: use the Cursor Chat.**\n",
    "    * Open Cursor Chat: Command + L.\n",

    "    * @Docs to refer to different documentation sources (about frameworks, etc) saved previously or stored by default in Cursor.\n",

    "    * @Codebase\n",
    "    * @Git to save versions\n",

    "* Mainly used for inline editing. Inline editing means that you want Cursor to help you creating or improving the code of the particular file you are in.\n",
    "* When you click Command + K you will see a box where you can tell Cursor what you want to do.\n",
    "* You will have the option to select the LLM model we use to create the coding responses. Right now, the best option is Claude 3.5 Sonnet and this is the one Cursor will use by default.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Chat with or without the codebase?\n",
    "* You can execute the chat by clicking Enter or Command + Enter. The difference between these two options is that the second one will use all the codebase as context. You can also use the @Codebase option and then you only need to clik Enter. Keep in mind that using all the codebase as context will be more expensive in the Cursor credits consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apply, Accept and Reject\n",
    "* After clicking Apply, you can also Accept (Command + Y) or Reject (Command + N) the changes one by one in the file.\n",

    "#### Calling the chat from inside a file\n",
    "* If you have an error in a file, you can hover over it and click on \"AI in Chat\". This will open the chat in a sidebar and will tell you how you can fix the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminal commands suggested by the chat\n",
    "* The chat can suggest to run one or more commands on terminal. If you click on the \"Run\" option in the chat box, this will write and run the command in the Cursor Terminal for you.\n",
    "\n",

    "* When you type @ in the chat, you will see a dropdown with different options to add @File, @Folder, @Docs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using screenshots, images, and diagrams as inspiration in the chat\n",
    "* You can load screenshots of similar apps to inspire Cursor in the right direction.\n",
    "* You can also use images created with drawing tools or generated by other AI frontend Coding Assistants like [v0](https://v0.dev/chat). Of course, in the case of v0 you can also use the generated code as inspiration in the chat.\n",
    "* If you want to use complex images or diagrams, it can be a good idea to select an LLM model like gpt-4o-mini in the chat box instead of Claude Sonnet 3.5 so the chat can better understand the contents of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using web search in the chat\n",
    "* Sometimes it can be interesting to use some web resource in your Cursor chat. Just use @Web before your search query, a web link like a particular page in a framework documentation, or any other online resource you want to use, and the chat will take care of it."
